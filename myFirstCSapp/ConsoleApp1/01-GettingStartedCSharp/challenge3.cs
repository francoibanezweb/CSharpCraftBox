Here's what you've learned about working with variables so far:

• You must assign (set) a value to a variable before you can retrieve (get) a
    value from a variable.

• You can initialize a variable by assigning a value to the variable at the
    point of declaration. Assignment happens from right to left. 

• You use a single equals character as the assignment operator. To retrieve the
    value from the variable, you merely use the variable's name.
